# Family Financial Analysis and Scoring System

This repository contains a comprehensive Family Financial Analysis and Scoring System built with Python, which processes family financial data, calculates health scores, and provides visualizations and an API for integration. The system is implemented using Jupyter Notebook, Flask API, and various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Overview

This project helps families assess their financial health by computing a financial score based on key metrics like savings, expenses, loans, credit card spending, and financial goals. The analysis is followed by visualizations and insights, and it also includes a Flask API to allow external applications to interact with the financial scoring system.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python version and libraries installed:

- Python 3.9+
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, flask, requests, gunicorn

## Notebook Structure

The notebook (`app.ipynb`) is organized as follows:

1. **Data Import and Setup**: Libraries are imported, data is loaded, and initial validation is performed.
2. **Data Analysis Section**: Family-level and member-level spending analysis, as well as financial metrics correlation analysis.
3. **Financial Scoring Model**: Scores are calculated based on multiple financial indicators.
4. **Visualization Section**: Visualizations using Plotly, including category-wise spending distribution, family-wise financial scores, and member-wise spending trends.
5. **API Implementation**: Flask API setup to calculate and return financial scores.

## Implementation Details

The financial scoring model calculates a score based on the following metrics:
- Savings-to-Income Ratio
- Monthly Expenses vs Income
- Loan Payments vs Income
- Credit Card Spending
- Financial Goals Achievement

These scores are then weighted to generate a final family financial score.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations are included:

1. **Spending Distribution**: Box plots to show the distribution of spending across categories.
2. **Financial Scores**: A bar chart to show the financial score for each family.
3. **Member Spending Trends**: Stacked bar charts to visualize trends in member-level spending.
4. **Financial Score Distribution**: A histogram showing the distribution of scores across all families.
5. **Correlation Heatmap**: A heatmap to visualize correlations between financial metrics.

## API Implementation

The project includes a Flask API that calculates the financial score for a given family. The API is designed to receive financial data as input and return the calculated score.

## Data Requirements

The Excel file should contain the following columns:

- Family ID
- Member ID
- Income
- Savings
- Monthly Expenses
- Loan Payments
- Credit Card Spending
- Financial Goals Met (%)
- Category
- Amount

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Data**: Ensure the data does not contain any missing or null values before processing. Handle missing values using imputation or data cleaning.
2. **API Issues**: Ensure Flask is running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`. Verify `gunicorn` server setup for production.
3. **Visualization Issues**: Restart the kernel if plots are not rendering. Update `plotly` or `matplotlib` if required.
