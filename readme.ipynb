# Family Financial Analysis and Scoring System

This repository contains a comprehensive **Family Financial Analysis and Scoring System** built with Python, which processes family financial data, calculates health scores, and provides visualizations and an API for integration. The system is implemented using Jupyter Notebook, Flask API, and various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Overview

This project is designed to help families assess their financial health by computing a financial score based on several key metrics, such as savings, expenses, loans, credit card spending, and financial goals. The analysis is followed by visualizations for better understanding and insights, and a Flask API that allows external applications to interact with the financial scoring system.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python version and packages installed:

- Python 3.9+
- Required Python libraries:
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    plotly
    flask
    requests
    gunicorn
    ```

You can install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/family-financial-analysis.git
    cd family-financial-analysis
    ```

2. **Set up the environment:**

    Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher and install all dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    Start Jupyter Notebook with:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook app.ipynb
    ```

    Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data, perform financial analysis, calculate scores, and visualize the results.

4. **Running the Flask API:**

    To start the Flask API, run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    This will start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`. You can test the API using the `requests` module, as shown in the notebook.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook (`app.ipynb`) is organized as follows:

### 1. Data Import and Setup (Cells 1-5)
- Library imports
- Data loading and initial validation

### 2. Data Analysis Section (Cells 6-8)
- Family-level and member-level spending analysis
- Financial metrics correlation analysis

### 3. Financial Scoring Model (Cells 9-12)
- Calculating scores based on multiple financial indicators (savings, expenses, loan payments, etc.)

### 4. Visualization Section (Cells 13-15)
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly, including:
    - Category-wise spending distribution
    - Family-wise financial scores
    - Member-wise spending trends

### 5. API Implementation (Cells 16-20)
- Flask API setup for scoring and data retrieval
- API testing with `requests`

## Implementation Details

### Financial Scoring Model

The `compute_family_financial_score` function computes a financial score for each family based on the following components:
- **Savings-to-Income Ratio**: 20% weight
- **Monthly Expenses vs Income**: 20% weight
- **Loan Payments vs Income**: 20% weight
- **Credit Card Spending**: 20% weight
- **Financial Goals Achievement**: 20% weight

```python
def compute_family_financial_score(row):
    # Calculate ratios
    savings_to_income_ratio = row['Savings'] / row['Income'] if row['Income'] > 0 else 0
    expenses_to_income_ratio = row['Monthly Expenses'] / row['Income'] if row['Income'] > 0 else 0
    loan_to_income_ratio = row['Loan Payments'] / row['Income'] if row['Income'] > 0 else 0
    
    # Weighted score calculation
    weights = {
        'savings_to_income_ratio': 0.2,
        'expenses_to_income_ratio': 0.2,
        'loan_to_income_ratio': 0.2,
        'credit_card_spending': 0.2,
        'goals_met_ratio': 0.2
    }
    
    # Final score computation
    # ... (full implementation details in the notebook)
```

### Visualization Examples

- **Spending Distribution**:
    ```python
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.boxplot(x='Category', y='Amount', data=financial_data)
    ```

- **Financial Scores**:
    ```python
    fig = px.bar(family_scores, x='Family ID', y='Financial Score')
    ```

## Visualizations

The following visualizations are included in the notebook:

1. **Spending Distribution**: Box plots showing the distribution of spending categories.
2. **Financial Scores**: A bar chart showing the financial score for each family.
3. **Member Spending Trends**: Stacked bar charts to visualize member-level spending trends.
4. **Financial Score Distribution**: Histogram showing the distribution of scores across all families.
5. **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualizing correlations between different financial metrics.

## API Implementation

The project includes a **Flask API** that calculates the financial score for a given family. The API is designed to receive financial data as input and return the calculated score.

### Sample API Request:
```python
import requests

data = {
    "income": 5000,
    "savings": 1000,
    "monthly_expenses": 2000,
    "loan_payments": 500,
    "credit_card_spending": 1000,
    "goals_met_ratio": 80
}

response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:5001/financial_score", json=data)
print(response.json())
```

## Data Requirements

The Excel file should contain the following columns:
- **Family ID**
- **Member ID**
- **Income**
- **Savings**
- **Monthly Expenses**
- **Loan Payments**
- **Credit Card Spending**
- **Financial Goals Met (%)**
- **Category**
- **Amount**

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Data**
   - Ensure the data does not contain any missing or null values before processing. Handle missing values using imputation or data cleaning.

2. **API Issues**
   - Ensure that Flask is running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.
   - Verify that the `gunicorn` server is set up properly for production.

3. **Visualization Issues**
   - Restart the kernel if plots are not rendering.
   - Update `plotly` or `matplotlib` if required.
