# Family Financial Analysis and Scoring System

This repository is dedicated to the development of a **Family Financial Analysis and Scoring System**. The goal of this system is to assist families in assessing their financial health by calculating a financial score based on various financial metrics. These metrics include savings, expenses, loans, credit card spending, and financial goals. 

The system uses Python to process family financial data, calculate scores, and generate visualizations that provide valuable insights. Additionally, it includes a Flask API to allow external applications to interact with the scoring system, making it highly integrable and versatile.

## Overview

This project is designed to help families evaluate their financial well-being by analyzing key financial indicators. The primary objective is to compute a financial score for each family, considering their savings-to-income ratio, expenses, loan payments, credit card spending, and the achievement of financial goals. This scoring system provides families with a clearer understanding of their financial position, allowing them to make informed decisions.

After the scoring, the system generates various visualizations to help interpret the data more effectively, such as category-wise spending distribution and financial score trends. Additionally, an API is provided, enabling external systems or users to calculate financial scores programmatically.

## Key Features

1. **Financial Scoring Model**: 
   The system evaluates each family's financial health based on key metrics, including savings, expenses, loans, credit card spending, and goals. The scoring model combines these factors into a single, comprehensive financial score that reflects the overall financial status of the family.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   The system performs detailed analysis of family-level and member-level spending, as well as examining correlations between different financial metrics, offering insights into how various factors influence a family's financial situation.

3. **Visualization Tools**:
   The system generates various visualizations to help families better understand their financial data. These include visualizations for spending distribution, financial scores, and trends in spending at the individual member level. 

4. **API for Integration**:
   A Flask-based API is included in the project, which allows external applications to calculate financial scores by providing family financial data. This makes the scoring system more flexible and usable in different contexts or by other systems.

## Data Requirements

To use the system, you need to input family financial data in a structured format. The data should include the following columns:
- **Family ID**: Identifier for the family group.
- **Member ID**: Identifier for each family member.
- **Income**: Monthly income of the family or individual member.
- **Savings**: Total savings.
- **Monthly Expenses**: Total expenses for the family or individual member.
- **Loan Payments**: Monthly loan repayment.
- **Credit Card Spending**: Monthly credit card expenditure.
- **Financial Goals Met**: Percentage of financial goals achieved.
- **Category**: The category of spending (e.g., utilities, food, entertainment).
- **Amount**: Amount spent in the respective category.

## Visualizations

The system provides several key visualizations to help users better understand the data:

- **Spending Distribution**: This shows the distribution of spending across different categories, which helps families identify areas of excessive spending.
- **Financial Scores**: A bar chart displays the financial score for each family, providing a clear comparison between families.
- **Member Spending Trends**: This visualization displays how spending trends vary among family members over time.
- **Financial Score Distribution**: A histogram shows the distribution of financial scores across all families, providing insight into the overall financial health of the sample.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: This heatmap illustrates the correlations between various financial metrics, helping identify relationships between spending, income, and savings.

## API Implementation

The system also includes a Flask-based API that allows external applications or users to calculate financial scores. The API accepts financial data as input and returns the calculated score. This integration allows for automation and makes the scoring system more accessible for users beyond just the Jupyter Notebook.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Data**: It's important to ensure that the data you are working with does not contain any missing or null values. If the data is incomplete, you may need to clean or impute the missing values to ensure accurate calculations.
  
2. **API Not Responding**: If the Flask API is not responding, check that the server is running and accessible. Ensure there are no conflicts with the port and that the correct endpoint is being hit for financial score calculation.

3. **Visualizations Not Rendering**: In case the visualizations do not load or render, try restarting the kernel of your notebook. Make sure that all required libraries (like Plotly or Matplotlib) are up to date.

## Conclusion

This Family Financial Analysis and Scoring System is a valuable tool for families to evaluate their financial health. By analyzing key financial metrics and generating insightful visualizations, families can make better financial decisions. The addition of an API ensures that the system can be integrated into broader applications and services, making it a versatile tool for financial management.
